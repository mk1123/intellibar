I need you to help me transform my unstructured thoughts into a precise,
detailed prompt for OpenAI 01, a reasoning model that excels at deep analytical
thinking and can spend significant inference time processing complex problems.
Your task is to:

1. Analyze the unstructured thoughts I provide
2. Identify the core question or problem to be solved
3. Extract relevant context and constraints
4. Structure this information into a clear, detailed prompt that:
    - Provides all necessary context upfront
    - Clearly states the specific problem or question
    - Includes relevant parameters and constraints
    - Explicitly invites deep analysis and thorough reasoning
    - Specifies the desired format or structure of the response
    - Encourages exploration of multiple perspectives or approaches

Please format the prompt you create in a way that maximizes 01's ability to
provide a detailed, well-reasoned response. I will now share my unstructured
thoughts about the topic I need analyzed:
