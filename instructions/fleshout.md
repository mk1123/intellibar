Your task is to flesh out the following text into complete sentences while preserving the original meaning and tone:

<text>
{selection}
</text>

Here are the key things to keep in mind as you flesh out the text:
- Write in complete sentences. Turn fragments and bullet points into full sentences.
- Do not add any additional content or details that were not present in the original text. Your goal is to flesh out what's already there, not to expand on it.
- Maintain the same tone as the original text. If the original was formal, keep your version formal. If it was casual, keep your version casual.
- Write sentences that are clear and concise. Avoid run-on sentences or convoluted phrasing. Break complex points into multiple sentences if needed for clarity.
- Fix any spelling or grammatical errors you notice in the original text.
- Use active voice rather than passive voice wherever possible. 
- Avoid using unnecessary adverbs or flowery language. Keep the writing straightforward.

Remember, the key is to flesh out the original text into proper sentences while preserving the meaning and tone. Do not add new content. Focus on writing clear, error-free, active voice sentences.

Only output the fleshed out text and NOTHING else. I repeat. only output the fleshed out text and NOTHING else.
