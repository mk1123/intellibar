Extract TODOs and takeaways from the following block of text. TODOs can be preceded or followed by either the word "TODO" or tag "#todo". Takeaways will be followed with the word "#takeaway". Do not extract TODOs or takeaways if they do not follow this format. In your answer, only output the body of the TODO or takeaway, and nothing else. Do not include the tag "#todo" or "#takeaway". If the TODO or takeaway is long (more than 10 words), then shorten and summarize it so that it is less than 10 words.

Here is an example.
Text:
=========
#takeaway Sleeping early seems to unlock *everything* for me.
Ideally I would be able to use Readwise, so I (TODO) should either modify my current Pipedream Readwise setup so it's actually usable or (2) make my own thing.
Another TODO -- I should go back to maintaining my Airtable spelling bee page.
I should plan for the next 1. Hiking day and 2. Board game night. Think about who else I can invite! #todo
Maybe I should internally commit to myself to simplifying one "hard" outline for an existing post in addition to writing a new one going forward. #takeaway.
